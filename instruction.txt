"encapsulation is hidding data and behaviour from outside."

"by defuelt Angular gives a unique attribute to every component,because of the encapsulation property witch is by defauth 
encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.Emulated ===> this means that every component has it's css and specification and encapsulation is rspected
encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None ===> with None property there no encapsulation and what css you apply to parent compoanet it is applied to all his child
there is also ..  encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom ===> witch means that the component with this property will not be affected with a global css property or 
an ViewEncapsulation.None from other parent component (so here encapsulation is respected again in this component) so it creates it's specific dom that is seperated from main dom."
